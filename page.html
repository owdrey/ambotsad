        My name is Audrey Albarillo. I am 14 years old. I love playing different sports. I mainly play badminton. This became my main sport since I was a kid. I've played badminton for 5 years but I stopped for 2 years because of the pandemic. Although, I wouldn't consider myself as a pro player as I still have a lot to learn. When I play during a competition, I am just like any other player, I feel nervous and excited at the same time. My goal is to have a gold medal and treasure it. All the competitions I joined, I've never received a gold medal but this doesn't stop me as I am passionate and determined that it is just a part of my journey. I will be to achieve my goal right?
